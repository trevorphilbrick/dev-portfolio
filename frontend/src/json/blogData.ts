      "# The Problem\n\nBuilding **PixelSnag** was born out of a frustration with clunky screenshot tools. I wanted something **fast**, **flexible**, and **cross-platform** that didn't feel like it was built in 2010.\n\n## The Inspiration\n\nEvery time I needed to capture a screenshot, I found myself:\n- Opening multiple apps\n- Dealing with confusing interfaces\n- Losing my workflow momentum\n\n## The Solution\n\nI decided to build my own tool that would:\n\n### Speed First\n- **One-click capture** from anywhere\n- **Instant editing** with smart tools\n- **Quick sharing** to any platform\n\n### Developer-Friendly\n- Built with **React** and **Electron**\n- **TypeScript** for reliability\n- **Modern UI** that feels native\n\n### Cross-Platform\n- Works seamlessly on **macOS**, **Windows**, and **Linux**\n- Consistent experience across devices\n- Cloud sync for your captures\n\n## The Result\n\nPixelSnag became the screenshot tool I always wanted - and it turns out, many others did too. Sometimes the best products come from solving your own problems. ```js \n console.log('hello world') \n```",
